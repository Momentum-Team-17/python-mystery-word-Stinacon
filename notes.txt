1. Open file, read it; make it into list of words. Words in the files are separated by new lines.

2. Select a random word.

3. Show number of letters in word, as underscores.

4. Ask user to guess.
    - keep count of guesses and wrong guesses (keep that in a list and find length of it)
        - if the guess is wrong, tell the user that it's wrong
    - keep track of the correct letter guesses
        - print/display if a guess is right in the string with the underscores âœ…
    - if letter has already been guessed, tell the user and don't take away a guess

5. Repeat step 4 while guesses is < 8, or if they guess all the right letters in the word correctly
    - if user reaches 8 wrong guesses, break and tell them they are out of guesses AND reveal the word
    - if the user guesses the word, tell them they are right and print the word

6. Ask the user if they want to play again. If so, start again at step 2.

*) KEY OF VARIABLES:
    - word to guess stored as: word_to_guess
    - length of word to guess (int): word_length
    - string of underscores = length of word to guess: underscore
    - word to guess underscores stored as list to iterate through: underscore_as_list
    - user guess stored as: user_guess
    - list to store accumulated right guesses: right_guesses
    - list to store accumulated wrong guesses: wrong_guesses
    - number of wrong guesses so far: wrong_guess_count
